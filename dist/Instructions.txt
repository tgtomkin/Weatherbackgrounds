WeatherBackgrounds.exe
Running this file will create/replace two pictures in a user-defined folder.
The first time the program is run, the user will select the folder.
The program stores the folder selected in settings.txt
Read the settings.txt section for more information.

To use as backgrounds, select the same folder as 'slideshow' option in windows.

It creates two photos because if you outright replace the photo windows is
using as the background image, it won't change. You have to have the
system use 'slideshow' to update them. I would recommend 10 minute slideshow
for 20 minute update
---------------------------------------------------
settings.txt
This file holds the user-defineable settings, explained below:

url -> the website to pull images from
	Currently defaulted to the NOAA weather satellite
	(updates with a new photo every 5 minutes)
output folder -> the place the pictures will go once downloaded
	Starts blank
	Updated when the user selects the folder on first startup
minutes -> how often to update the photos
	Starts at 20 minutes, edit file and restart program to change
